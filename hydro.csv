Some of our data holdings date back to the 1930s. The polygons comprising the index show the extent of the survey datasets. The attributes attached to each polygon will enable you to view, amongst other attributes, the age and quality of the bathymetric data. Please refer to the LINZ Bathymetric Index Data Dictionary for further information about the attributes of this dataset. The bathymetric data is not downloadable from the LINZ Data Service. Datasets prior to the year 2000 are predominantly available only as georeferenced TIFF images of the original hard copy sounding sheets. Data post-2000 is often available as both georeferenced TIFF images and as digital data files (vector data in plain text format). Requests for the bathymetric data should be sent to customersupport@linz.govt.nz with “Hydro Bathy Data” in the subject line. Requests must, as a minimum, specify the id, chart_no and serial_no as shown in the attributes attached to each polygon representing the datasets of interest.

Please refer to the LINZ Bathymetric Index Data Dictionary for further information about the attributes of this dataset. The bathymetric data is not downloadable from the LINZ Data Service.

Requests must, as a minimum, specify the id, chart_no and serial_no as shown in the attributes attached to each polygon representing the datasets of interest.
